# Retail-Parity Evidence

This directory will contain the deterministic baseline definition, scripted
input fixtures that contain no retail data, comparison-tool documentation, and
per-milestone results.

No parity baseline has passed yet.

The first task is to evaluate `platform/native_replay_scheduler.c`,
`platform/native_checkpoint.c`, `platform/native_savestate.c`, and
`docs/REPLAYS.md` against a running 32-bit build. A usable gate must:

1. replay identical per-frame inputs;
2. compare game-visible state without embedding host pointer values;
3. cover startup, menus, racing, powerslides, items, transitions, and saves;
4. detect an intentional state mutation;
5. report the first divergent frame and field or region.

Screenshots and playtesting supplement this gate; they do not replace it.
