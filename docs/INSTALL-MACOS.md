# Install CTRPad on macOS

CTRPad is a native Apple Silicon application for macOS 11 or newer. The app
contains no Crash Team Racing data. On first launch it asks you to choose your
own compatible NTSC-U single-track raw MODE2/2352 BIN.

Build `CTRPad.app` locally using the short sequence below, or use a
`CTRPad-macOS-arm64-*.zip` from a tagged
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/ctrpad/releases) when one is
available.

## Quick local build

```sh
brew install cmake ninja
git clone https://github.com/chrissotraidis/ctrpad.git
cd ctrpad
cmake --preset macos-arm64-app
cmake --build --preset macos-arm64-app
ctest --preset macos-arm64-app --output-on-failure
open build-macos-arm64-app/CTRPad.app
```

## Install a packaged build

1. Download `CTRPad-macOS-arm64-*.zip` from a GitHub release that includes a
   macOS package, or build the app locally as described below.
2. Open the archive and move `CTRPad.app` to Applications.
3. Open CTRPad.
4. Choose your own compatible retail BIN when prompted.

A Developer ID-signed and notarized release opens normally. An ad-hoc-signed
developer preview is not notarized; on first launch, Control-click the app,
choose **Open**, and confirm macOS's prompt. Do not disable Gatekeeper
system-wide.

CTRPad validates the selected image before starting. CUE files, compressed
archives, cooked 2048-byte ISOs, other regions, and incomplete images are not
accepted. The app remembers the selected file's external path and does not
copy it into `CTRPad.app`. Keep the BIN at that location.

To deliberately choose a different image from Terminal:

```sh
/Applications/CTRPad.app/Contents/MacOS/CTRPad --choose-disc
```

## Controls

The window is resizable and preserves the game's 4:3 presentation. Use `F11`
or `Option-Return` to enter or leave fullscreen.

| PlayStation input | Keyboard | Mouse |
|---|---|---|
| D-pad / steer | `W` `A` `S` `D` or arrow keys | — |
| Triangle / View / Back | Escape or `Z` | — |
| Square / Brake | `E` or `X` | Right button |
| Cross / Gas | Either Shift key | Left button |
| Circle / Item | Space or `V` | Middle button |
| L1 / R1 drift | `Q` / `R` | Mouse 4 / Mouse 5 |
| L2 / R2 | Control keys | — |
| Start / Pause | `P` or Return | — |
| Select | Tab | — |

Click the **•••** button at the top right of the game window to change either
binding for every PlayStation input or restore the defaults. Press Backspace
while capturing a binding to clear it. Remapping changes only CTRPad's host
keyboard aliases, not any control setting stored by the retail game.

Standard SDL-compatible Bluetooth and USB controllers are supported alongside
keyboard and mouse input. macOS, iOS, and iPadOS use the same standard SDL
gamepad-to-PlayStation mapping.

## Saves, logs, and preferences

CTRPad keeps writable data outside the application bundle under:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/chrissotraidis/CTRPad/
```

That directory contains memory-card saves and `Crash Team Racing.log`. App
updates do not need to replace it. The remembered disc path and custom keyboard
bindings are macOS app preferences, not copies of the game.

## Build locally

Install Xcode or its command-line tools, CMake 3.20 or newer, and Ninja:

```sh
cmake --preset macos-arm64-app
cmake --build --preset macos-arm64-app
ctest --preset macos-arm64-app
```

The app is written to `build-macos-arm64-app/CTRPad.app` and ad-hoc signed for
local execution.

Create a retail-free distributable archive from a clean checkout:

```sh
./package-macos.sh --build
```

Maintainers with a Developer ID Application identity and notarytool profile
can produce a hardened, notarized archive:

```sh
./package-macos.sh --build \
  --identity "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
  --notary-profile CTRPad-Notary
```

The package script verifies the bundle architecture, metadata, icon,
signature, source identity, required legal resources, and absence of retail or
runtime data before writing the ZIP and SHA-256 sidecar under ignored `dist/`.
