# CTR Native

A native PC port of Crash Team Racing (PS1, 1999), built on top of the [CTR-ModSDK](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-ModSDK) decompilation project.

## Philosophy

- **No byte budget.** Game source lives in `game/` as our own copies. Edit freely.
- **No PSX toolchain.** Targets Windows and Linux with SDL3. No MIPS compiler needed.
- **Clean platform layer.** `main.c` owns process startup; host details stay in `platform/native_*`.
- **No build system nonsense.** Just `build.bat` / `build.sh`.
- **Fully static build.** Single executable, zero dependencies. SDL3 is compiled from vendored source and linked statically.

```

## Prerequisites

### Windows

The recommended native Windows toolchain is MSVC x86:

1. Install Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Build Tools 2022.
2. Select the **Desktop development with C++** workload and a current Windows SDK.
3. Ensure CMake 3.20 or newer is on `PATH` (standalone or the Visual Studio C++ CMake tools component).
4. Run `build-msvc.bat`, or select the `windows-msvc-x86` CMake preset in CLion.

The existing MinGW i686 build remains supported:

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
2. In an MSYS2 terminal:
   ```
   pacman -Syu
   pacman -S --needed git mingw-w64-i686-gcc mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-make
   ```
   If the update asks you to close the terminal, reopen MSYS2 and run the install command.
3. Add `C:\msys64\mingw32\bin` to your system PATH
4. Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell and run `build.bat`.

That's it. SDL3 is compiled from vendored source -- no separate install needed.

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```
sudo apt install gcc-multilib
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxext-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libudev-dev libdbus-1-dev
```

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

Install Xcode or the Xcode Command Line Tools, CMake 3.20 or newer, and Ninja.
The `macos-arm64` preset produces the exact bare Mach-O used by parity work.
The separate `macos-arm64-app` preset produces a launchable application
bundle without embedding retail game data.

## Building

```
build-msvc.bat       # Windows, MSVC x86 (recommended)
build.bat            # Windows, MinGW i686
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh           # Linux
```

The shared CMake presets can also be used directly or selected as CLion CMake profiles:

```
cmake --preset windows-msvc-x86
cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-x86-debug
ctest --preset windows-msvc-x86-debug
```

On Apple Silicon:

```sh
cmake --preset macos-arm64-app
cmake --build --preset macos-arm64-app
ctest --preset macos-arm64-app
```

First build compiles SDL3 from source. This is cached as a static library in the selected build directory.

Output:

- MSVC: `build-msvc-x86/Release/ctr_native.exe`
- MinGW: `build/ctr_native.exe`
- Linux: `build/ctr_native`
- macOS bare parity build: `build-macos-arm64/ctr_native`
- macOS application build: `build-macos-arm64-app/CTRPad.app`

### Clean build

```
rmdir /s /q build    # Windows: delete cached libraries
build.bat            # Windows: rebuild everything

rmdir /s /q build-msvc-x86
build-msvc.bat       # Windows MSVC: rebuild everything

rm -rf build/        # Linux: delete cached libraries
./build.sh           # Linux: rebuild everything
```

## Running

### Normal Setup

If you downloaded a release build, you only need two things for normal play:

1. The game executable:
   - `ctr_native.exe` on Windows
   - `ctr_native` on Linux
2. Your own NTSC-U retail CTR disc image, named (put in directory called `assets`):
   - `assets/ctr-u.bin`

Example:

```
CTR-Native/
  ctr_native.exe
  assets/
    ctr-u.bin
```

Then run `ctr_native.exe`.

The disc image must be the common single-track raw PSX BIN layout: MODE2/2352 sectors, with the data track starting at byte 0. A cooked 2048-byte `.iso` does not preserve the XA/STR sector data needed for audio and video playback.

For the macOS app build, keep the retail image outside the application bundle
and launch with:

```sh
CTRPAD_DISC_IMAGE="/absolute/path/to/CTR - Crash Team Racing (USA).bin" \
  tools/run-macos-arm64-app.sh
```

The launcher validates the raw-sector byte size and creates only an ignored
development symlink at `build-macos-arm64-app/assets/ctr-u.bin`. It never
copies the disc image into `CTRPad.app` or Git. Internal recording arguments
can be passed through, for example
`tools/run-macos-arm64-app.sh --record --detailed`.

The app preset targets the macOS 11.0 ARM64 floor and applies an ad-hoc local
signature that binds the bundle metadata. Distribution signing and
notarization are separate release steps and are not implied by this
development signature.

For the current iOS/iPadOS development build:

```sh
cmake --preset ios-simulator-arm64
cmake --build --preset ios-simulator-arm64

cmake --preset ios-device-arm64
cmake --build --preset ios-device-arm64

# Validate and create a retail-free unsigned IPA under dist/.
./package-ios.sh
```

`package-ios.sh --build` combines the device build and packaging steps. It can
also validate a user-supplied Apple identity/profile and emit a signed IPA;
without them it emits an unsigned IPA for a compatible user-side re-signing
tool. The packager enforces thin ARM64/iOS metadata, the standard
`Payload/CTRPad.app` layout, byte-reproducible archive timestamps, legal/source
installation resources, and retail/runtime-data exclusion. See
`docs/INSTALL-IOS.md` for signing, direct-device, and AltStore-style sideload
instructions.

The generated `CTRPad.app` and IPA contain no retail data. On a first launch with no
media, CTRPad presents a native **Choose CTR disc image** screen. Select your
own NTSC-U single-track raw MODE2/2352 BIN through Files. CTRPad copies the
selection to `Documents/CTRPad/assets/ctr-u.bin`, validates its disc identity
and required contents, and starts the game in the same app process. Cancelling
or choosing an invalid file leaves the chooser available, and an invalid
selection never replaces an existing verified import. As a manual fallback,
Files sharing still permits placing the correctly named image directly in that
directory.

Imported media takes priority over any development-only bundle fallback.
Logs, memory cards, and private diagnostics are stored separately in
Application Support and persist independently of the app bundle. Simulator
acceptance covers the picker, cancellation, invalid-format rejection, a full
valid import, same-process startup, cold relaunch, a game-created memory-card
save, background/foreground survival, app-update retention, and a later cold
read of that profile through the retail Load screen after explicitly seeding
the accepted report bytes into the default private root. Wrong-region live UI,
physical-device Files/save behavior, distribution signing, and the final
sideloaded-device acceptance remain roadmap work. See
`docs/parity/2026-07-31-ios-files-import.md` and
`docs/parity/2026-07-31-ios-memory-card-atomicity.md` for the runtime boundaries,
and `docs/parity/2026-07-31-ios-sideload-package.md` for exact packaging evidence.

For development builds run from `build/`, put the same `assets/ctr-u.bin` next to the source tree:

```
ctr-native/
  build/
    ctr_native.exe
  assets/
    ctr-u.bin
```

### Keyboard Controls

The desktop build accepts both the original compact key map and a more
comfortable two-hand test layout. The aliases are additive: existing scripts
and testers can keep using the original keys.

| PS1 input | Test layout | Original layout | Common racing use |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-pad | `W` `A` `S` `D` | Arrow keys | steer, aim items, navigate menus |
| Triangle | `I` | `Z` | skip race fly-in, menu action |
| Square | `J` | `X` | brake/reverse, menu action |
| Cross | `K` | `C` | accelerate, menu action |
| Circle | `L` | `V` | use item, menu action |
| L1 / R1 | `Q` / `E` | Left Shift / Right Shift | hop and drift |
| L2 / R2 | Left Ctrl / Right Ctrl | Left Ctrl / Right Ctrl | camera / mapped retail input |
| L3 / R3 | `[` / `]` | `[` / `]` | mapped retail input |
| Start | `P` | Return | pause or advance |
| Select | Tab | Space | Select |

For a basic race test, steer with `A`/`D`, hold `K` to accelerate, use `J`
to brake, tap `L` for an item, and use `Q` or `E` to hop/drift. Keyboard
presses are translated to the same PS1-shaped pad packets as a controller;
no keyboard-only physics path is used.

Click the game window before testing. In iOS Simulator, also enable its
hardware-keyboard capture for the running app. macOS keyboard play is accepted;
Computer Use key injection produced no SDL keyboard events in the Simulator,
and a physical keyboard on a real iPad has not yet passed the device acceptance
gate.

### iOS/iPadOS Touch Controls

The iOS build presents a native safe-area-aware touch overlay after the game
surface starts. Touch is composed as player one's peer input, so a connected
MFi controller can remain active without disabling the overlay.

| Touch control | Retail input | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Left virtual stick | Left analog stick | continuous steering |
| Stick outer ring | D-pad | reliable menu navigation while retaining analog steering |
| **GAS ✕** | Cross | accelerate / confirm |
| **BRAKE □** | Square | brake, reverse / menu action |
| **ITEM ○** | Circle | use item / menu action |
| **VIEW △** | Triangle | camera or skip / menu action |
| **L DRIFT / BOOST** | L1 | hop, hold drift, fire boosts |
| **R DRIFT / BOOST** | R1 | alternate hop/drift side |
| **PAUSE** | Start | pause or advance |
| **SELECT** | Select | retail Select input |

Quick keyboard and touch edges remain active for two host snapshots so an
input update immediately before the next approximately 29.9 Hz retail pad
poll cannot erase a tap. Simulator tests have navigated the main menu in both
directions, selected Adventure, opened **Load**, and displayed a persisted
profile using only the overlay. A later touch-only run entered Time Trial,
selected Crash and Crash Cove, skipped the fly-in, accelerated off the grid,
paused, reflowed the controls after device rotation, and resumed. Physical-
iPad ergonomics, performance, human simultaneous steering/acceleration, and
repeated three-boost drift chains remain open. On iPadOS 26 the app supports
all scene orientations and dynamic resizing: portrait and landscape cold
launches are valid, and the renderer plus touch overlay reflow to the current
safe-area bounds. iPhone and older full-screen iPadOS builds retain the
landscape preference. The current overlay is a functional prototype, not the
final control layout. See `docs/parity/2026-07-31-ios-touch-controls.md`.

### Extracted Asset Override

You do not need extracted assets for normal play.

Extracted files are still supported for development, modding, and debugging. If present, they override files from `ctr-u.bin`.

Extracted-asset override structure:

```
CTR-Native/
  ctr_native.exe
  assets/
    BIGFILE.BIG
    SOUNDS/KART.HWL
    TEST.STR
    XA/
      ENG.XNF
      ENG/EXTRA/S00.XA ... S05.XA
      ENG/GAME/S00.XA ... S20.XA
      MUSIC/S00.XA ... S01.XA
```

The full extracted asset list is:

- `BIGFILE.BIG`
- `SOUNDS/KART.HWL`
- `TEST.STR`
- `XA/ENG.XNF`
- `XA/ENG/EXTRA/S00.XA` through `S05.XA`
- `XA/ENG/GAME/S00.XA` through `S20.XA`
- `XA/MUSIC/S00.XA` through `S01.XA`

## Bug Replays

Internal builds can record a small bug report folder. See `docs/REPLAYS.md`.

## Architecture

```
main.c (entrypoint)
  |
  +-- platform/native_* (platform shell, audio, input, memcard, CD, renderer, PSX facade glue)
  |
  +-- game/game_unity.h
        |
        +-- game/ (all decompiled game source)
              |
              +-- include/ (headers: structs, globals, declarations)
```

- `CTR_NATIVE` is defined for native host/platform-specific code
- First-party native code targets portable C17 with compiler extensions disabled
- The default build uses 32-bit mode while remaining PSX address-shaped data and host-pointer contracts are audited. GPU primitive links are bridged through 24-bit native tokens; see `docs/MEMORY_MODEL.md`.

## Roadmap

- Clean up `game/` copies strip byte budget hacks and route platform-specific code through `CTR_NATIVE`
- Keep reducing 32-bit host-pointer assumptions in PSX-shaped data, and keep pruning inherited compatibility code now owned in `include/` and `platform/`.
